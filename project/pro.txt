create a java customer management system with the following microservices (all microservices should be integrated with each other) : 
use these technologies : spring boot , spring data jpa , postgressql 


5.Feedback Management Microservice : customer_id from customer profile microservice as foreign key
					feedback_id as primary key 
					feedback_text


integrate this with the customer profile microservice , Service Subscription microservice , Order Management Microservice , Customer support Microservice

create a java customer management system with the following microservices (all microservices should be integrated with each other) : 
use these technologies : spring boot , spring data jpa , postgressql 

1.Customer profile microservice : customer_id as primary key
		     first_name 
		    last_name
		email
		phone_number
		address 
use this table to map with all the microservices
			
2.Service Subscription microservice : customer_id from customer profile microservice as foreign key
					subscription_id as primary key
					4 subscription plans should be displayed 
					plan - one plan should be choosed by client
					time_period : should be generated based on the selected plan

3.Order Management Microservice :  customer_id from customer profile microservice as foreign key
					plan from Service Subscription microservice as foreign key
					order_id as primary key
					start_date - date of order
					end_date - 30 days from the date of order
4.Customer support Microservice :  which handles requests and tickets 
with the variable foreign key as customer id from the customer profile microservice
primary as request id
variable issue is the issue requested by the customer and 
the status of the request issued by the customer

5.Feedback Management Microservice : customer_id from customer profile microservice as foreign key
					feedback_id as primary key 
					feedback_text


6.Notification Microservice : customer_id from customer profile microservice as foreign key
				notification message should be generated in mail format using JMS based on Customer profile microservice,Order Management Microservice,Customer support microservice - for eg account has been created , updated , deleted , order placed cancelled , ticket solved , pending
